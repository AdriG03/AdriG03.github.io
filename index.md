### CPSC 120

* Lab 3, Part 1

Lab 3 was one of my favorites because I've always been curious about how IBM works for different people based on gender, age, and weight. It's fascinating to see how different each answer is for each person. Using math functions in our code to create equations to calculate IBM was also excellent practice for future programs.

* Lab 6, Part 2

In lab 6, I enjoyed learning how to code a game of Blackjack. Learning to play alone was enjoyable and made me want to play the real game. But in the program, I enjoyed learning how to use the Boolean data type to identify a specific card and how that would affect the code later on, and ultimately return a score.

* Lab 9, Part 2

Writing Lab 9 with my partner was fascinating and eye-opening. Creating a small guessing game with a secret number was a nice challenge. Using the if statements, std::cout, and std::cin objects to make the guessing possible was the highlight of this part of the lab.
